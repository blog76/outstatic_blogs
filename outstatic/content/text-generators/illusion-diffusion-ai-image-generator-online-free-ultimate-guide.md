![](/images/illusion-diffusion-ai-kzOT.png)Illusion Diffusion is a new AI image generator from Hugging Face. This tutorial will guide you on how to use it and includes a bonus on how to improve your artwork's visual impact.

## **Introduction**

Learn how to create Illusion Diffusion AI art using Google Colab's free tier instead of the slow Hugging Face tool that has gone viral in recent days.

## **What is IllusionDiffuison AI Art?**

**Illusion Diffusion AI** is a technology that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to transform ordinary images into real and visually captivating artworks. It achieves this by applying various illusions, prompts, and parameters to create unique and mesmerizing visual effects in the final output.

## **Getting Started with Illusion Diffusion AI Art**

Now, let's explore the process of creating art. Firstly, go to the IllusionDiffusion Hugging Face page by clicking here.

### **The Illusion Diffusion Interface Walkthrough**

Choose or upload an image in the Illusion Diffusion interface.

## **How to Create Mesmerizing Art**

After setting parameters, the input image is transformed with the chosen illusion. Different prompts, strengths, and illusions can be experimented with to achieve the desired artistic effect. Examples will be shown.

### **Example 1: Changing the Prompt and Strength**

Experiment 1: Used spiral illusion with strength of 1, resulting in mesmerizing spiral effects added to image. Positive prompt crafted to describe the video. Image chosen to encapsulate illusion.

### **Example 2: Exploring Different Strengths**

Illusion Spiral has strengths of 1.2 and 1.4, which produce varying levels of impact on the image.

### **Example 3: Trying a Different Image and Seed**

Illusion: Sand Clock Illusion, Strength 1.2, Changed seed values can lead to unique and intriguing outputs.

In this experiment, we chose to test the AI by feeding it a picture of a sand clock. The cue was changed to "nebula," and the strength was set to 1.5. It is worth noting that changing the seed value might result in different outcomes within the same parameters.

### **Example 4: Pushing the Limits**

Spiral Strength: 1.7 Illusion

As a result, greater strength levels provide more severe impacts.

You may unleash unlimited creative possibilities with Illusion Diffusion AI art by playing with different parameters.

## **Using Google Colab for Faster Results**

We recommend utilizing Google Colab to speed up the process because the Hugging Face interface might be sluggish due to excessive demand.

### **Step 1: Access Google Colab**

You can view a Colab file that I made for you. To begin, simply open the file. Navigate to Runtime >> Run all.

**Step 2: Upload Your Image**

Google Colab, unlike Hugging Face, provides speedier performance because you are the only user. You will upload your system's input picture here.

### **Step 3: Select Your Parameters**

Similar to Hugging Face, you can customize your parameters by selecting your illusion, setting the strength, crafting a positive prompt, and deciding on the seed value.

### **Step 4: Run the Colab**

Start the Colab process by clicking "Run" as the sole user, and observe the AI transform your image without waiting times.

## **Bonus: Upscaling Your Art**

We have an additional tip for you, as promised. You may enlarge AI-generated artwork up to ten times its original size for better printing and presentations.

To use the upscaling tool, look for the link in the video description or pinned comment.

Choose Your Image: Select the artwork you wish to enlarge.

You may upscale the image up to ten times its original size by using the Upscaling Factor.

Click "Restore Image" to create a high-quality, upscaled version of your artwork.

## **Resources for Your Creative Journey**

We have other resources for you. Prompts, reference photos, seed values, and strength values are available via a Google Drive link supplied. These resources will let you experiment and fine-tune your AI art.

## **Conclusion**

Illusiondifussion AI is a fantastic AI Image generator that generates illusions based on a question and an input image. You may unlock your imagination and create magnificent artwork by following this step-by-step approach and experimenting with different settings.

Thank you for joining us on this artistic adventure. Have fun crafting!
