I've been dabbling in the world of GPTs recently, and let me tell you, it's been an adventure. This week alone, I tested over 250 different GPTs, with lots more on my list.

But don't worry, I've got your back—I've whittled down the top ten GPTs that I feel will blow your mind.

## **1\. Prompty – Your Personal Prompt Engineer**

Let's get started with "Prompty." This is your particular prompt genius at work. It's all about building the appropriate prompt for your requirements, whether you're trained in Chain of Thought or few-shot prompting.

I put it to the test by requesting an SEO blog prompt, and wow, did it deliver!

A thorough, engaging SEO-optimized blog article prompt appeared immediately. It's a game changer in terms of improving your Chat GPT results.

## **2\. Calendar GPT – Your Personal Assistant**

Following that, we have "Calendar GPT," your ticket to transforming ChatGPT into a personal assistant.

GPT Calendar

Sync it with your calendar, whether personal or professional. It takes some time to integrate, but once linked to your personal or work calendar, it transforms into your personal assistant.

Consider asking, "How is my day going?" as well as obtaining a well-organized routine. It may need some Zapier integration wizardry, but trust me when I say it's well worth it.

## **3\. Canva GPT – Graphic Design Simplified**

Have you ever heard of "Canva GPT"? This is a fantastic tool for making presentations, logos, and social media postings. While it is still in its early stages, it is positioned to become a go-to for visual design inside ChatGPT.

I tried it out for an Instagram post—the results were a little off, but the potential is there.

Just a heads-up: there is no official GPT shop yet, so be cautious with your personal information.

## **4\. BABYAGI.TXT – Task Manager**

Now for "BABYAGI.TXT," your GPT chat discussion saver. It converts your interactions into text files, which you may use to make to-do lists or organise your day. This implies that making to-do lists and organising plans has just become a lot easier.

It's essentially a task manager version of Chant GPT that provides a smooth method to organise your ideas.

## **5\. Tech Support Advisor – Your Tech Wizard**

Do you require technical assistance? Tech Support Advisor might be the solution. Among the 16 GPTs introduced by Chat GPT, this one stands out for technical inquiries.

When it came to setting up a printer or troubleshooting, it was far superior to conventional Chat GPT.

## **6\. Simpsonize Me – Quickly Image Transformation**

Simpsonize Me allows you to submit a photo and have it transformed into a Simpson-style figure. Upload a photo and it will turn it into a Simpsons character.

Me, Simpsonized

But it's a hit-or-miss situation—it worked wonderfully for my colleague but not so well for me. Give it a go for some oddball entertainment.

Have you ever wished to play a text-based escape room game? "Escape The Haunt" accomplishes exactly that! It creates visuals with hints, providing a fascinating text-based puzzle-solving experience. A great distraction for some mind-bending amusement.
