## **Writing the perfect prompt for your patterns**

### <br>



**1\. Core Prompt: The Foundation of Your Pattern**

Choose a core prompt for your pattern that resonates with your vision. You can opt for animals, nature elements, or abstract shapes.

Examples include flowers, geometric shapes, butterflies, leaves, and palm trees. A more specific and detailed core prompt can lead to more intricate designs.

### **2\. Style: Setting the Tone of Your Pattern**

Select a style for your pattern to align with your creative vision and add a distinct flavor to your design.

Explore various styles such as abstract, vintage, modern, or minimalistic.

Use phrases like “A modern pattern of [core prompt]” to incorporate a style into your prompt.

Examples of prompts with different styles include “A minimalistic pattern of leaves,” “A vintage-inspired pattern of flowers,” and “An abstract pattern of geometric shapes.”

### **3\. Artist: Infusing Artistic Influence**

<br>

Adding an artist's name to your prompt can give your pattern a specific look and feel. It allows you to draw inspiration from famous artists and their unique styles. Some artists whose names you can use in your prompt are Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Yayoi Kusama, and Henri Matisse.

By including an artist's name in your prompt, you can make it more distinct and original. For instance, you could create “a pattern of leaves inspired by Yayoi Kusama” or “a geometric pattern inspired by Piet Mondrian.”

### **4\. Finishing Touches: Adding Flourish to Your Design**

<br>

Finishing touches enhance the overall aesthetic of patterns. Examples include subtle or contrasting colors, high or bold lines, fine lines, and organic or geometric shapes.

Combining these touches can make patterns even more unique, such as a vintage-inspired pattern of flowers with bold lines and high contrast.

### **5\. Prompt Weighting: Tailoring Your Pattern**

Patterned AI's prompt weighting feature allows for precise customization of design elements such as colors and shapes.

Parentheses ( ) increase attention by a factor of 1.1, double parentheses (( )) by 1.21, and square brackets [ ] decrease attention by 1.1. Custom weighting factors can also be specified.

Patterned AI eliminates the frustration of creating seamless patterns and allows for efficient design creation with technology. Focus on bringing your visions to life.
