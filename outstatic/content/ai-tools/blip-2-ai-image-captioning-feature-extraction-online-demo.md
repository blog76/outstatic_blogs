Blip-2 is a technique that combines Vision Transformer knowledge and Language Model expertise to extract features and text from images. This article showcases the Online Demo of Blip-2 image captioning and its use for Image Extraction. Blip-2 uses Bootstrapping Language Image Pre-Training with Frozen Image Encoders and LLMs.

## **What is Blip-2?**

Blip-2 is an innovative technique using Transformers to connect vision and language models, enabling tasks such as image captioning, content moderation, multimodal search, and visual question answering.

It uses a specialized Transformer interface called Q Format to seamlessly integrate and train models for enhanced AI capabilities.

### **Understanding Blip-2: A Bridge Between Vision and Language**

Blip-2, introduced by Salesforce Research on January 30, 2023, combines vision and language to create various applications such as image captioning for visually impaired individuals, content moderation beyond text, image text retrieval for multimodal search and autonomous driving, and visual question answering for interactive Q&A based on images.

### **The combination of Transformers: Vision & Language**

The key is to understand the transformative aspect of Transformers in vision and language models. Whether it's T5, Flan, or Vision Transformers, the architecture is important.

Blip-2 connects these Transformer architectures - a vision Transformer and a language Transformer.

## **The Q Format: A Transformer for Bridging Modalities**

The Q Format serves as a bridge between vision and language Transformers, addressing the modality gap. It consists of an Image Transformer and a Text Transformer, both utilizing self-attention layers.

### **The Blip-2 Training Process: Unveiling the Stages**

#### **Stage 1: Vision Language Representation Learning**

Connects Q Format to Frozen Image Encoder and trains using contrasting and matching loss functions with specific image-text pairs.

#### **Stage 2: Vision Language Generative Learning**

Condense the text into its original language:

Blip-2 is versatile as it allows the combination of different visual backbones and language models to create powerful Vision Language Transformers.

### **Coding the Blip-2 Pipeline: Bringing Theory into Practice**

In our next session, we will focus on coding. We will go through the steps, create our own app, and maybe even look into using Gradio. In the end, we will have a fully functional Vision Language Transformer model that we can use.

## **How to use Blip-2?**

Go to the Hugging Face platform, search for Blip-2 in spaces, upload an image, ask questions about the image, and submit.

## **How to generate an Image Caption?**

Go to Hugging Face platform > spaces and search for Blip-2 salesforce. Upload the image and click on the 'Caption it' button.

## **Conclusion:**

Blip-2 allows caption writing and text extraction from images, aiding accessibility and inclusivity by providing image descriptions for the visually impaired.
