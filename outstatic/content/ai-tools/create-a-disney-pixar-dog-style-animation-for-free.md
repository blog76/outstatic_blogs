AI-generated films are now a reality, and the greatest thing is that they are completely free to make. In this post, we'll show you how to create Disney Pixar-style AI animations for free in 2023.

We'll teach you how to correctly produce images with a fantastic free image generator, as well as how to turn these photos into high-quality animation scenarios.

## **Here’s How This Method Works**

To make AI-generated animations, first produce a picture of the scenario you want to depict.

You may bring this image to life and affect the outcome with specific prompts and inputs to get your desired results.

This approach entails creating graphics with a free image generator and then bringing these images to life with a second program.

I wanted to make a trailer for a Disney Pixar Dog AI film, therefore I used ChatGPT to write a script for a short non-existent Disney Pixar trailer.

I'll make the pictures based on this script. I'm using Leonardo AI for these photographs, which allows you to produce 150 images for free every day. You can produce ultra-realistic photographs if you know how to utilize it.

I'll utilize the 3D animation model to create a Disney Pixar-style animation.

## **How to Generate the Perfect Images for Your Animations for Free?**

To begin, create the pictures that will be used in your animation.

Create a new account at [leonardo.ai](http://leonardo.ai).

Take the following steps:

### **Step 1: Create a Prompt Template**

Begin by creating a prompt template that defines your situation. Include the topic, a description of the scene, and the image's desired style.

If you're doing an animation with a little boy astronaut in a Disney Pixar style, your prompt may be “A dog with brown hair in a Disney Pixar movie style.”

### **Step 2: Configure Settings**

Check that your settings are accurate before creating the picture. Disable the “photo reel,” “Alchemy,” and “prompt magic” sliders, especially if you're using the free version of the program.

For videos, select the proper aspect ratio, such as 16:9.

### **Step 3: Generate the Image**

When you press the “generate” button, the program will generate a picture based on your prompt. Every day, you may make up to 150 photos for free.

### **Step 4: Enhance Image Quality**

Upscale the image to get the greatest possible quality for your animations. To ensure a high-resolution image, select the “HD crisp upscale” option.

### **Step 5: Refine Your Prompts**

You can tweak your instructions if the created image isn't precisely what you're searching for. Describe what you want to include in the image, and consider activating negative prompts to describe what you don't want to see.

### **Step 6: Experiment**

Experiment with various cues and parameters until you are happy with the image quality.

## **How to Make Your Animations for Free?**

You now have the ideal photos for your animations. Let's look at how to make animations using these photos.

Pika Labs AI will be used for this stage of the process.

### **Step 1: Visit Pika Labs**

To get started with animation generating, go to the Pika Labs website and click the “join beta” button.

### **Step 2: Start Generating**

Pika Labs includes a number of generating rooms where you may make films. Begin by entering “award SL” and then choosing “anime.” Use the prior tool to upload the image you made.

### **Step 3: Write a Prompt**

Create a question that characterizes the video's theme, scenario, and style. Because Pika Labs may make movies up to 3 seconds long, be specific when describing movement in the environment.

### **Step 4: Adjust Metrics**

You can adjust metrics to influence the video outcome. These metrics include negative prompts, FPS, guidance scale, camera movement, amount of motion, and seed number.

### **Step 5: Generate and Experiment**

Generate a video and experiment with prompts and settings for the desired results. Adjust camera movement and guidance scale for fine-tuning animation.

### **Step 6: Download the Video**

Download the animation to your computer when you're done.

## **How to Upscale Your Generations for Amazing Quality for Free**

Download the video from Pika Labs and upscale its quality using a tool like CapCut for a better final output.

## **How to Get High-Quality Sound Effects and Copyright-Free Background Music?**

Choose the right audio elements for your videos by using a platform like Epidemic Sound that offers high-quality music and sound effects to avoid copyright issues.

### **My Preferred AI Voice-Over Software:**

Consider using Fliki AI for voice-overs in your animations. Fliki offers a variety of realistic voiceovers to bring your characters to life.

### **My Preferred Free Editing Software:**

For video editing, select any preferred editing software. CapCut is a free and user-friendly tool for beginners. Import elements like images, animations, sound effects, and music into your software and edit as desired. If new to video editing, watch tutorials for your chosen software to learn the basics and create a polished final product.
