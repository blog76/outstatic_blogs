AI-generated films are now a reality, and the greatest thing is that they are completely free to make. In this post, we'll show you how to create Disney Pixar-style AI animations for free in 2023.

We'll teach you how to correctly produce images with a fantastic free image generator, as well as how to turn these photos into high-quality animation scenarios.

## **Hereâ€™s How This Method Works**

To make AI-generated animations, first produce a picture of the scenario you want to depict.

You may bring this image to life and affect the outcome with specific prompts and inputs to get your desired results.

This approach entails creating graphics with a free image generator and then bringing these images to life with a second programme.

I wanted to make a trailer for a Disney Pixar Dog AI film, therefore I used ChatGPT to write a script for a short non-existent Disney Pixar trailer.
