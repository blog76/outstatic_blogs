AI-generated films are now a reality, and the greatest thing is that they are completely free to make. In this post, we'll show you how to create Disney Pixar-style AI animations for free in 2023.

We'll teach you how to correctly produce images with a fantastic free image generator, as well as how to turn these photos into high-quality animation scenarios.

## **Here’s How This Method Works**

To make AI-generated animations, first produce a picture of the scenario you want to depict.

You may bring this image to life and affect the outcome with specific prompts and inputs to get your desired results.

This approach entails creating graphics with a free image generator and then bringing these images to life with a second programme.

I wanted to make a trailer for a Disney Pixar Dog AI film, therefore I used ChatGPT to write a script for a short non-existent Disney Pixar trailer.

I'll make the pictures based on this script. I'm using Leonardo AI for these photographs, which allows you to produce 150 images for free every day. You can produce ultra-realistic photographs if you know how to utilise it.

I'll utilise the 3D animation model to create a Disney Pixar-style animation.

## **How to Generate the Perfect Images for Your Animations for Free?**

To begin, create the pictures that will be used in your animation.

Create a new account at [leonardo.ai](http://leonardo.ai).

Take the following steps:

### **Step 1: Create a Prompt Template**

Begin by creating a prompt template that defines your situation. Include the topic, a description of the scene, and the image's desired style.

If you're doing an animation with a little boy astronaut in a Disney Pixar style, your prompt may be “A dog with brown hair in a Disney Pixar movie style.”

### **Step 2: Configure Settings**

Check that your settings are accurate before creating the picture. Disable the “photo reel,” “Alchemy,” and “prompt magic” sliders, especially if you're using the free version of the programme.

For videos, select the proper aspect ratio, such as 16:9.

### **Step 3: Generate the Image**

When you press the “generate” button, the programme will generate a picture based on your prompt. Every day, you may make up to 150 photos for free.

### **Step 4: Enhance Image Quality**

Upscale the image to get the greatest possible quality for your animations. To ensure a high-resolution image, select the “HD crisp upscale” option.

### **Step 5: Refine Your Prompts**

You can tweak your instructions if the created image isn't precisely what you're searching for. Describe what you want to include in the image, and consider activating negative prompts to describe what you don't want to see.

### **Step 6: Experiment**

Experiment with various cues and parameters until you are happy with the image quality.

## **How to Make Your Animations for Free?**

You now have the ideal photos for your animations. Let's look at how to make animations using these photos.

Pika Labs AI will be used for this stage of the process.

### **Step 1: Visit Pika Labs**

To get started with animation generating, go to the Pika Labs website and click the "join beta" button.

### **Step 2: Start Generating**

Pika Labs includes a number of generating rooms where you may make films. Begin by entering "award SL" and then choosing "anime." Use the prior tool to upload the image you made.

### **Step 3: Write a Prompt**

Create a question that characterises the video's theme, scenario, and style. Because Pika Labs may make movies up to 3 seconds long, be specific when describing movement in the environment.
