Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to combine GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) with Zapier to automate operations across many apps without writing a single line of code.

GPTs from OpenAI have exceptional data-drawing capabilities, making them extremely powerful.

Today, I'll show you through a real-world example of how to use Zapier to build up a GPT to recognise an invoice, extract critical information, and automate actions.

## **Intro: Power of GPTs and Zapier Integration**

The availability of GPTs by OpenAI has transformed AI capabilities, notably in data extraction from many platforms. Zapier is one of the most accessible and effective ways to create this integration.

This technology links hundreds of apps effortlessly via readily customizable actions, making it an excellent partner for realizing the full potential of GPTs.

## **Step 1: Link Your ChatGPT and Zapier Accounts**

The initial step is to connect your ChatGPT and Zapier accounts. To get started, sign up for a free Zapier account (if you haven't already) and make sure it's the same account you use for ChatGPT.

Go to the supplied website address after your accounts have been created.

Simply authorise authorization for your GPT to connect with Zapier, allowing for frictionless activities between both.

## **Step 2: Configuring Actions with Zapier**

Now, let's get started on creating a Zapier action tailored to your GPT. Go to the specialised website dedicated to GPT AI activities by clicking here.

Begin by creating a new action that defines tasks for your GPT to do.

You can begin by selecting an action, such as 'Gmail send email.'

Configure fields like 'to,''subject,' and 'body,' determining if AI should assume the text or if you want to hardcode certain values.

## **Step 3: Creating a New GPT and Linking with Zapier**

Continue by creating a new GPT and configuring it. Import the necessary data from the specified URL here to ensure successful Zapier connection.

Give your GPT a name and personalise your interface with features like profile image choices.

## **Step 4: Naming and Personalizing Your GPT**

Give your GPT a distinct name that corresponds to its functionality to improve user experience.

Additional options, such as profile image settings, may be used to further personalise the GPT's interface, making it more recognisable and user-friendly.

## **Step 5: Bringing It All Together â€“ Configuring GPT Instructions**

It's now time to synchronise the GPT's activities with the Zapier instructions. Edit the GPT to request the Zapier actions and IDs.

These identifiers will tell you which actions to take and how to do them. Create detailed instructions for your GPT, including the activities it should complete.

Instruct the GPT, for example, to extract specified data fields from an invoice image and create an email using the retrieved information.

## **Testing Your GPT Integration**

Run an example job to test the operation of your configured GPT.

Upload an invoice image, for example, to see if the GPT correctly extracts the relevant data and sends the pre-configured email via Zapier.

Confirm that the activities were carried out as expected, guaranteeing smooth functionality.

## **Next Steps: Exploring**

These GPT-Zapier connectors have enormous possibilities for automating a variety of processes. While GPTs in ChatGPT are extremely useful, they may not be appropriate for large business applications.

The new OpenAI Assistance API provides more technical prowess but also more complexity. Keep an eye out for future videos on leveraging this potential for larger applications.

## **Final Words:**

Finally, the combination of GPTs and Zapier provides a new, user-friendly solution to task automation, streamlining workflows across various apps.

Following these steps will allow you to effortlessly construct and customise GPTs to meet your individual needs, enabling new opportunities for effective automation.

I hope this lesson has helped you understand the possibilities of GPTs integrated with Zapier.
