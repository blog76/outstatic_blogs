We'll guide you through loading the Safetensors Stable Diffusion model in Google Colab in this tutorial.

## **How to use Safetensors Stable Diffusion?**

<br>

**Step 1: Access Google Colab**

<br>

Get started with Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for running Python code using Google Drive.

To access it, go to the Google Colab website, click "Sign In" and enter your Google credentials if prompted.

### **Step 2: Download the Model File**

<br>

Before using the Safetensors Stable Diffusion model, we need to obtain the required model file. You can find it at the following link: loadsafetensors.ipynb.

Click the link to download the model file to your computer. Remember the location where you saved it as we will need to upload it to Google Colab.



### **Step 3: Upload the Model File to Google Colab**

<br>

Upload the model file to Google Colab by clicking the "Upload" button in the workspace and selecting the file from your computer.
