Relume AI is an AI-based website builder tool that generates content and wireframes for websites. This article explores using Relume AI for a client project. The author has been skeptical about AI tools for generating entire websites, as they often overlook decision-making in the design process.

## **The Importance of Decision-Making:**

Can AI truly cater to clients' unique needs based on a text prompt? Most AI website builders produce generic and uninspiring sites by bypassing essential design steps. However, Relume AI aims to assist designers without taking away creative control and deliver sites that meet clients' specific requirements. It saves time while respecting the designer's role in the process. Let's see how it works.

## **What is Relume AI?**

Relume AI offers tools and resources to assist web designers and developers, especially those using Figma and Webflow. Their mission is to empower designers in the era of no-code and generative AI. Relume was originally an agency, but now provides products and solutions for the design and development community.

## **Relume AI Site Builder:**

Relume AI Site Builder is a tool for web designers to quickly create wireframes and sitemaps. It has a component library with over 1000 components tailored for Figma and Webflow and can generate copy for web pages.

The tool is compatible with popular web design tools and allows for collaborative sharing. It also automatically names classes and syncs style guides for efficient design work.

## **How to Create a website using Relume AI? Step by Step!**

### **Step 1: Visit Relume AIâ€™s official website:**

To start with Relume AI, go to their website, [relume.io](http://relume.io).

They have different products, but the one you want is the AI Site Builder, which combines multiple products. Here's how you can use it:

### **Step 2: Creating a Prompt:**

The prompt is about designing a portfolio website for a friend who runs a filmmaking business specializing in short-form videos and photography.

Challenging to decide how many pages are needed. Estimate and tool generate pages accordingly.

### **Step 4: Initial Pages:**

After creating pages, a new homepage and other pages like About Us, Services, Portfolio, Projects, and Blog will be generated by the tool.

You can decide to keep or remove these pages according to your project's needs.

### **Step 5: Customization:**

You can customize your website by removing or modifying sections as necessary. For instance, if your client doesn't require a blog, you can delete that section. The tool enables you to make these adjustments instantly.

### **Step 6: Wireframe and Design:**

Explore AI-generated wireframe design as a starting point for your project.

### **Step 7: Feedback and Collaboration:**

Relume AI has a client-sharing feature, but it may be restricted to the free plan. However, on the paid plan, you can easily collaborate with clients by sharing wireframes and designs.

## **Relume AI Pricing:**

Relume AI has three pricing options: Free Plan, Starter Plan ($32/month), and Pro Plan ($40/month). The Free Plan is good for experimenting with the tool for a single project. The Starter Plan allows up to three projects, while the Pro Plan offers unlimited project support and is ideal for professionals and agencies. The Pro Plan also includes a 7-day trial period.

## **Exporting wireframes to Figma:**

It emphasizes the importance of installing the Relume Library Figma plugin and demonstrates how to import wireframes into a Figma project.

## **The Promise of Time Savings**

Relume AI can save time for designers who charge hourly rates for their services. By using AI-generated wireframes, designers can potentially save three to four hours on a 10-hour project.

## **Relume AI: A Critical Evaluation**

I am skeptical of AI-driven solutions, but after trying Relume AI, I see its potential for streamlining the design process. While it cannot replace human creativity, it can enhance efficiency and inform decision-making.

The ability to collaborate with clients by sharing wireframes and designs is a valuable feature, although there may be limitations on the free plan.

This tool can help designers and web developers expedite their workflow and deliver effective results. However, it is important to remember that design is not just about aesthetics, but also understanding the client's unique needs and creating a tailored solution.

AI can be a helpful tool, but it does not replace the interaction, research, and creative intuition between the client and designer.

## **Conclusion:**

Relume AI balances AI automation and creative input, assisting designers by saving time on wireframe creation and allowing them to focus on creative aspects. As design evolves, tools like Relume AI can enhance the design process and are worth trying.
