![](/images/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-mastery-course-kyNT.png)Welcome to ChatGPT Prompt Engineering, a field that has been gaining attention in the AI community. Professionals in this field can earn up to $350,000. In this article, we will explore the world of prompt engineering and provide a free course to help you master this skill.

## **What Will We Cover?**

This course covers the basics of prompt engineering, including essential terminologies like AI, NLP, GPT, and LLM. We will also explore different types of prompting and how it influences AI language models. Additionally, we will delve into advanced prompts to showcase the full potential of prompt engineering.

## **Basic Terminologies: Understanding AI, NLP, GPT, and LLM**

In this part, we'll build the basis by becoming acquainted with certain fundamental terms.

### **What is AI?**

The first is AI, which is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence. To put it simply, AI is the process of training computers to think, learn, and understand like humans.

It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, allowing computers to create content, solve hard issues, and even code!

### **What is NLP?**

![](/images/natural-language-processing-626101995-YzNz.png)NLP, which stands for Natural Language Processing, comes next. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching computers to understand human language.

When we ask an AI a question, NLP helps it to understand and reply intelligently.

### **What is GPT?**

GPT is an NLP AI model that stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. GPT-3, with its huge 175 billion parameters, has been a game-changer in the realm of AI language models.

It can understand human language and respond appropriately.

### **What is LLM?**

Let us now discuss LLM, which stands for Large Language Model.

LLM refers to language models, such as GPT-3, that include a large number of parameters and are extremely strong in natural language processing applications.

## **What is Prompt Engineering?**

This is the thrilling part! Our course is built around prompt engineering.

So, what is it exactly?

Prompt engineering is the practise of creating the appropriate text (prompts) to extract the finest possible replies from AI language models such as GPT-3.

We interface with these models as prompt engineers, guiding them through prompts to produce precise and desired results.

Consider a chat with ChatGPT, where the text you enter is the prompt.

The better this question is written, the more accurate and relevant the response you will receive.

Prompt engineering allows us to optimise our interactions with AI and accomplish exceptional outcomes.

## **Practice Prompting: The Core of Prompt Engineering**

We will practice prompt engineering with ChatGPT to achieve impressive results. This course mainly focuses on ChatGPT, but the principles can be applied to other AI language models.

## **Types of prompt:**

Two prompt types: "Prompt by Example" and "Direct Prompting.

" Prompt by Example involves giving the AI a sample response format to generate similar responses, while Direct Prompting is straightforward. To excel in prompt engineering, assign a specific role to the AI, be clear in instructions, and encourage clarifying questions.

## **Prompt Engineering Examples: Advanced Prompts**

Explore advanced techniques for prompt engineering such as the "Step by Step" approach and providing a specific style or tone to the AI's response, such as Shakespearean.

### **Example 1: Crafting Catchy YouTube Video Titles**

Assume you're a professional YouTuber in need of appealing video titles. You may get excellent results by using rapid engineering.

*Here's an example of direct or straightforward prompting.*

*![](/images/simple-or-direct-prompting-1024x483-UwMj.png)<br>

You may now begin using prompt engineering in this location.*

Begin by assigning a role to the AI, such as "You are an expert in writing viral YouTube titles."

### **Example 2: Building a SaaS Website Step by Step**

In this example, we'll demonstrate the effectiveness of the **"Step by Step" **method.

![](/images/prompt-engineering-prompt-example-2-1024x540-MxNz.png)

You may obtain more in-depth and detailed advice on developing a SaaS website by supplying a job and information and guiding the AI to consider step by step.

![](/images/prompt-engineering-prompt-example-2-step-by-step-1024x583-c4OT.png)

The AI will ask questions to learn about your exact requirements, and the end result will be a clear and precise strategy for your project.

### **Example 3: Learning Quantum Computing in a Fun Way**

AI has the potential to be an outstanding teacher!

In this example, we'll show how quick engineering can make it easier to master complicated concepts like quantum computing.

### **Example 4: Coding with AI Assistance**

AI can, in fact, write code! We'll look at how you can tell the AI to write Python scripts or code in any language.

![](/images/coding-with-ai-assistance-1024x164-Q2Nz.png)<br>

You'll obtain customised and correct code if you provide a position as an experienced programmer, define your work in depth, and ask the AI to enquire more.

### **Example 5: Generating Mock Data for Data Analysis**

Prompt engineering isn't only for text. It may also be used for data analysis.

In this example, we'll instruct the AI to produce fake Google search results.

You may choose which fields to display in the data and even format it in a table for simple examination.

## **Other Factors: Temperature, Model, and Top-p**

In prompt engineering, other important factors to consider are Temperature, Model, and Top P. These settings affect the style and randomness of the AI's response. Understanding and adjusting these parameters will help you get the desired results.

### **1\. Temperature**

Temperature in AI refers to the creativity of the AI's responses. Higher temperature leads to more diverse and unpredictable outputs, while lower temperature generates more precise and reliable responses.

### **2\. Model Selection**

GPT-3 and GPT-2 are different versions of the same model. Model selection is important as they have different capabilities and sizes. GPT-3.5 is good for some tasks, while GPT-2.5 is better for others. It depends on your needs and desired results.

#### **What is a Model?**

As an engineer, you should know about AI models which are responsible for the functioning of AI. OpenAI has created different models, including the recent GPT-3 models like Davinci-003 that can handle up to 4000 tokens. However, what is a token?

#### **What is Token?**

Tokens are the basic units of text used in AI models such as ChatGPT. When a text is input into the AI, it is tokenized, which involves dividing it into smaller parts. In this instance, a token is defined as a four-character word. Therefore, if a model like Davinci-003 can handle 4000 tokens, it implies that it can handle nearly 4000 four-character words. This is a substantial amount to work with!

### **3\. TopP (Top Probability) Sampling**

TopP sampling is a useful technique in prompt engineering that selects from the top probabilities in an AI's response distribution to control the randomness of its output. This ensures that the AI produces relevant and focused responses, even at higher temperature settings.

### **4\. Maximum Tokens**

Attention prompt engineers! Be mindful of the number of tokens used in your prompt as AI models like GPT-3 have a maximum token limit. If the prompt exceeds this limit, it needs to be truncated or rephrased to fit within the token constraint.

### **5\. Importance of Context**

Context is crucial in prompt engineering. Take into account the conversation's context and previous interactions with the AI when creating prompts. This helps the AI comprehend the conversation's flow and provide more coherent responses.

### **6\. Fine-Tuning**

"Take prompt engineering to the next level with fine-tuning - training an AI model on specific data to customize its behavior and responses. Although more advanced, the results can be mind-blowing. But be aware of the challenges and considerations that come with fine-tuning."

## **3 Important Things To Do Now**
