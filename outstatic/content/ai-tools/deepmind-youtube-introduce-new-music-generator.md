Google DeepMind has unveiled the Lyria model, an AI technology being tested in an experimental initiative called “Dream Track” on YouTube.

The technology allows a select group of creators to use AI-generated voice and musical styles inspired by artists like Alec Benjamin, Charlie Puth, Demi Lovato, and Sia to create unique soundtracks. These artists have collaborated with YouTube and DeepMind and given permission for their voices to be used in new compositions.

## **Collaborative Efforts between YouTube and DeepMind**

YouTube and DeepMind have developed a way to watermark AI-generated audio, which is undetectable to the average listener but becomes visible when analyzing the waveform.
