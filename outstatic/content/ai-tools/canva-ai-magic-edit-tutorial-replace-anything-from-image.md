### **What to Avoid When Using Magic Edit:**



Remember to avoid adding faces and hands for now.



Stick to adding one thing at a time and refrain from using celebrities or well-known brands to stay on the safe side of copyright.



Keep in mind that there may be limitations with this new technology, such as slight pixelation in the unedited parts of your photo.



But don't let that stop you from experimenting with Magic Edit's powers!



### **Experiment with Magic Edit Beta Version**



Magic Edit is a Canva AI tool that is still in Beta and continuously developing. If the desired results are not achieved at first, keep experimenting to master the photo editing tool.
