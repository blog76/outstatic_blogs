#### **1\. Turn Off Auto Suggestions**

Disabling auto suggestions allows uninterrupted writing without AI-generated interruptions. This preserves your unique voice and prevents AI from dominating your thoughts. To use AI suggestions selectively, press Ctrl + J for assistance.

#### **2\. Choose the Content Tone**

Select the appropriate tone for your academic context, such as an academic tone for research articles.

## **Step 4: Crafting Your Headings and Outline**

Customize your research article by writing clear headings and subheadings to organize your thoughts. Use headings like “Introduction,” “Methods,” “Results and Discussion,” and “Conclusion.” Subheadings can help break down your content into manageable sections.
