Learn how to create personalized AI-generated avatar images using an open-source and free-to-use AI. Follow along as I demonstrate how I transformed 20 of my photos into a diverse array of artworks.

## **What is Dreambooth AI?**

Dreambooth AI is a free and open-source platform that uses AI to generate images from user-provided photos. It runs on Google Colab and can create AI-generated images even for users without high-end GPUs. Users can upload their photos, train the AI data, and generate personalized images using various prompts and settings.

## **How to Generate AI Avatar using Dreambooth AI?**

### **Taking the Photos:**

Capture 20 photos of yourself with a modern smartphone, using a 1:1 aspect ratio.

Take three full-body shots, five chest-to-head images, and twelve close-ups of your face. Vary your expressions and angles, but maintain even lighting without strong shadows.

### **Resizing the Photos:**

To resize your photos to 512 by 512 pixels, you can use Photoshop or a provided link for resizing images in a browser.

### **Dreambooth Google Colab:**

Now, let's explore the Dream booth Google Colab link, which may appear complicated but is actually easy to use. Simply follow the instructions in the Colab document, activate the nodes, and run the code. This platform utilizes Google's GPUs to generate images, even if you don't have a high-end GPU.

Sometimes, running the code may result in warnings, especially if you're not a paid member. However, there are solutions such as using a different email or paying for access.

By following the step-by-step instructions, you can install the necessary components and create a Hugging Face account to generate access tokens.

Click on the play button to install the requirements.

### **Hugging Face Account Setup:**

To integrate Dreambooth with Hugging Face, create an account on [Huggingface.co](http://Huggingface.co) and generate an access token by clicking on Tokens in your profile.

### **Dreambooth Continued:**

This node involves adjusting settings and defining prompts, such as class names (“person,” “woman,” or “man”), to train AI data using the provided images.

Name the folder that contains the resized images.

Specify the class name (e.g., person, woman, man) for improved outcomes.

Save all training data and models to your Google Drive.

### **Start Training:**

Training data requires adjusting settings like class names and training steps.

It's a time-consuming process that takes between half an hour to an hour, and you should avoid leaving the page to prevent data loss. Ensure your prompts align with your desired output, then run the node and wait for the training process to complete.

### **Generating Avatars:**

Generate AI artwork by inputting prompts, running nodes, and experimenting with different prompts and the guidance scale.

Use Lexicon for new ideas and tweak the scale for more refined results.
