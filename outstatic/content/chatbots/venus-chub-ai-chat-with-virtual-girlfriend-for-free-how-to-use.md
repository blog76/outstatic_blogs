## **Introducing Chub Venus and Kobold AI**

To chat with a virtual girlfriend, we need two important elements: Chub Venus AI and Kobold AI. Let's discuss each component.

## **What is **[**Venus.Chub.ai**](http://Venus.Chub.ai)**?**

Venus Chub AI is a platform for interacting with various AI characters, including creating your own characters for chat and interaction.

### **Venus Chub AI: Your Virtual Character Hub**

Chub Venus is a great platform for character enthusiasts. It lets you interact with various characters and create your own. It is an alternative to other character AI platforms like Character AI, Janitor AI, and Silly Tavern AI.

### **Kobold AI: You're Chatting Companion**

To chat with a character on Chub Venus, you require a chatbot model. However, these models are not free on the platform. But, you can use Kobold AI's free API key to connect with the model. API keys are unique codes that allow you to connect with AI models and start chatting. Essentially, you need two things to start chatting with your virtual girlfriend: Chub Venus AI's web interface and a model obtained through Kobold AI using an API key.

## **How to Chat with Virtual Girlfriend with Venus Chub AI?**

Now, let's proceed with a guide to assist you in setting up and initiating a conversation with your virtual companion.

## **Step 1: Visit the Chub Venus AI website**

## **Step 2: Get Your API Key from Kobold AI**

Chub Venus AI provides the stage, but we need an actor to play our part. To enable virtual conversations, you need an AI model. This is where Kobold AI comes in. Kobold AI lets you connect with AI models using API keys, which are special keys that give you access to these models.

Let's go through the process.

### **2\.1: Access the Kobold AI Google Colab Notebook**

On mobile, press "play" and then play the music.

PC users can directly choose a model without skipping this step. When choosing a model, remember to select the "United" option.

### **2\.2: Generate the API Key**

Click the second "play" button after choosing your model and wait for the API link to be sent to you.
